I'm a first year MS CS student at New York University and an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical engineering. I'm passionate about everything surrounding Machine Learning, Generative Models, Graph Theory, and theoretical Deep learning.

Prior to this, I was a Senior Member of Technical Staff at Oracle, in the  DB Transactions where I worked on the development and designing of a new cloud-optimized storage infrastructure for Oracle database utilizing NVM-optimized data structures and storage media. I have been a deep learning intern at Digital Innovations Lab, IIM Bangalore where I worked on developing models to classify diabetic retinopathy grades with CNNs. Later I interned at Samsung Research Institute where I developed methods to enhance Bixby Search using probabilistic topic modelling and word embeddings. Based on my performance, I received a pre-placement offer at Samsung for the role of software developer.

My research
======
My work on [Routing algorithms for Quantum networks] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668578) is my first attempt at academic research, and this got me hooked onto mathematically challenging problems. The work took me through methods such as MDPs that play a vital role in the field of Reinforcement Learning, to Lyapunov Drift Stabilisation- a key component of Queuing Theory.
