I'm an alumni of Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical engineering. Despite being an electrical engineer by degree, my area of interest revolves around areas such as Machine Learning, Graph Theory, Algorithms, Time Series Analysis and Queueing Theory. 

I presently work as Member of Technical Staff at Oracle, in the  DB Transactions where I work on the development and designing of a new cloud-optimized storage infrastructure for Oracle database utilizing NVM optimized data structures and storage media. I have been a deep learning intern at Digital Innovations Lab, IIM Bangalore where I worked on developing models to classify diabetic retinopathy grades with CNNs. Later I interned at Samsung Research Institute where I developed methods to enhance Bixby Search using probabilistic topic modelling and word embeddings. Based on my performance, I received a pre-placement offer at Samsung for the role of software developer.

A Breadth First Search into CS
======
While exploring Computer Science, my approach was simple- dabble through every sub-field first, and take a deep dive on the most rewarding topics. As David Epstein in his book 'Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World' mentions: in most fields—especially those that are complex and unpredictable—generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They’re also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can’t see. With my wide array of coursework I've tried to implement the same, learn every aspect of computer science- from data structures to distributed systems to deep learning and graphical models. Subjects that are inter-related yet offering different flavours of computer science. 

Statistical Learning for the win!
======
Unless we understand what goes on inside the black box, how are we to be good researchers?

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
