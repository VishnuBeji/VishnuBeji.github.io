excerpt: 'This paper considers the problem of secure packet routing at the maximum achievable rate in a Quantum key distribution (QKD) network. Assume that a QKD protocol generates symmetric private keys for secure communication over each link in a multi-hop network. The quantum key generation process, which is affected by noise, is assumed to be modeled by a stochastic counting process. Packets are first encrypted with the available quantum keys for each hop and then transmitted on a point-to-point basis over the communication links.'
